--Q1: Write a UNION query to show a combined list of all unique cities from the students table and the patients table. Order alphabetically.
SELECT city 
FROM nairobi_academy.students
UNION
SELECT city 
FROM city_hospital.patients
ORDER by city asc;

--Q2: Write a UNION ALL query to combine all student first names and all patient full names into one list. Add a second column called source that says 'Student' or 'Patient' so you can tell where each name came from.
(SELECT 
    first_name AS name,
    'Student' AS source
FROM nairobi_academy.students)
UNION ALL
(SELECT 
    full_name AS name,
    'Patient' AS source
FROM city_hospital.patients);

--Q3: Write an INTERSECT query to find cities that appear in BOTH the students table and the patients table - cities that are home to both students and patients.
SELECT city 
FROM nairobi_academy.students
INTERSECT
SELECT city 
FROM city_hospital.patients;

--Q4: Write a query that combines all of the following into one result using UNION ALL - student names (labelled 'Student'), patient full names (labelled 'Patient'), and doctor full names (labelled 'Doctor'). Order the final result by the source label, then by name.
SELECT 
    first_name AS name,
    'Student' AS source
FROM nairobi_academy.students
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    full_name AS name,
    'Patient' AS source
FROM city_hospital.patients
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    full_name AS name,
    'Doctor' AS source
FROM city_hospital.doctors
ORDER BY source, name;
